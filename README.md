A compilation of different drush make files, as well as a script to replace a Drupal 6 installation with Pressflow 6.

I got some of the makefiles from various Github repos. Credit goes to original authors!

## Sample run

    drush make ~/.dev/drupalkit/kr6.make dev
    ~/.dev/drupalkit/preinstall6
    <install your app in your browser>
    ~/.dev/drupalkit/postinstall6
